                Grew up in New Jersey, I moved to Seattle almost 12 years ago for work.  
                Before Code Fellows I was working for an Architecture Design Firm in 
                Seattle, in the Technical Support department. Before that I worked at a 
                Software Company that made design software, there I did Software support 
                and testing.
                I Went to school at Drexel University in Philadelphia, PA, for a bachelors 
                degree in Architectural Engineering.  I've taken some classes in 
                Programming and Database design.  I've also been using TeamTreehouse.com and 
                lynda.com to learn.
                My goal is to learn to be a software developer and build app for design, 
                IT, and gaming.
